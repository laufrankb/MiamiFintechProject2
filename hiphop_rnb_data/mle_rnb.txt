with goodbye Think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die? No, not I, I can't find your house, send me the info Drivin' through the gated residential Found out I was comin', sent your friends home Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know I only call you when it's half past five The only time I'd ever call you mine I only love it when you touch me, not feel me When I'm f- up, that's why you like it, baby, who cares? But I know you care Bring it over to my place And you be like, baby, come and see, you and me Heartbreak anniversary 'Cause I remember every time On these days that feel like you and me Heartbreak anniversary, do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know, I'm here just waiting for you Come on over, I'll give my all to you You're my end and my beginning Even when I lose, I'm winning 'Cause I give you all of me loves all of you Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts Risking it all, though it's hard to face reality Love and death are quite similar How they come and go like cat burglars Reality is kinda hard to say, my baby When you're in pain, my baby When your life is breaking down and is out of your mind He
