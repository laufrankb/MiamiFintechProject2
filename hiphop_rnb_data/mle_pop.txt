world around me Had no time to choose what I chose to do So go easy on me, baby Like a damn sociopath! I've lost my mind, I've lost my mind, oh, uh, uh Well, you only need the light when it's late at night And it's me and you So happy Christmas I love you baby I can see a better time When all our dreams come true They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold But the wind goes right through you It's no place for the old When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve You promised me Broadway was waiting for me You were handsome You were pretty Queen of New York City When the band finished playing They howled out for more Sinatra was swinging, All the drunks they were singing We kissed on a corner Then danced through the night The boys of the NYPD choir Were singing "Galway Bay" And the bells are ringing out For Christmas Day
