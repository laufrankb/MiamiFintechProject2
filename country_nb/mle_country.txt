AA every day One step at a time, yeah Life's hard, family's weird Sometimes you just need a beer Can I get an Amen? (Amen) Man, I'm just tryna stay out of AA (AA, ooh) Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I wannasee is you 'Cause all I wannaride 'til I can't no more I got the horses in the back Where I sit alone And think of losing you I spend most every night Beneath the light Of a neon moon The jukebox plays on Drink by drink And the words of every sad song Seem to say what I think And this hurt inside of me Ain't never gonna end Ooh, but I lost all control And I need you now And I don't mean to pry I saw the tears fallin' from your eyes, and I thought You're too pretty not to wear a smile Hope you don't like it? Maybe you might be different Will it kill you to tell me how to feel This love is difficult, but it feels too good If I could turn it off, you know you left this hole Right here in the middle of my soul Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh Five minutes out of downtown Ain't nothin' better We beat the odds together I'm glad we didn't listen Look at what we would be missin' They said, "Maybe I should see them for myself" Yeah, but all I brought back with me Was some sand in my boots I said, "Hey babe, what time you comin' home?" I'd be a legend at loving and leaving Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings You thought the West was wild but you ain't saddled up with me If I was a cowboy, I'd be a legend at loving and leaving Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings You thought the West was wild but you ain't saddled up with me If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free I close my eyes And sometimes see You in the shadows Of this smoke-filled room No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried Or how many lies That I've lied Telling my poor heart He'll come back someday Ooh, but I do Guess I love chasing after you Ooh, ooh
