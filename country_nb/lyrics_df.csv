52815945,Enchanted,Taylor Swift,"There I was again tonight Forcing laughter, faking smiles Same old tired, lonely place Walls of insincerity Shifting eyes and vacancy Vanished when I saw your face All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you  Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?"" Across the room, your silhouette Starts to make its way to me The playful conversation starts Counter all your quick remarks Like passing notes in secrecy  And it was enchanting to meet you All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you  This night is sparkling, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home I'll spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you  The lingering question kept me up 2 a.m., who do you love? I wonder 'til I'm wide awake And now I'm pacing back and forth Wishing you were at my door I'd open up and you would say Hey, it was enchanting to meet you All I know is I was enchanted to meet you  This night is sparkling, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home I'll spend forever wondering if you knew...
