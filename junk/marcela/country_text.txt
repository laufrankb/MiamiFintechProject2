midnight, staying up till dawn There's something in the dust and wind that keeps me hanging on And I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd say "goodbye"  I ain't crying, that's west texas in my eye  I'll be your blue eyed bandit if you'll be my renegade I count a thousand tumbleweeds roll by me everyday I'd like to grow a rose and stow it in that desert sage Like a message in a bottle floating down the open plains Where the llano estacado rises up to meet the sky  I ain't crying, that's west texas in my eye  I've seen the thunderheads descend and rip into the ground The twisted hand of heaven spreading terror all around Sending farmers into deeper debt and ranchers to the grave Where towers mark the end of time with slowly spinning blades 'Til the water table falls below the reach of humankind  I ain't crying, that's west texas in my eye  Lately I've been thinking, I could leave this town Cut back on my drinking, stop this running around Playing songs 'til after midnight, and staying up till dawn But there's something in the dust and wind that keeps me hanging on And I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd say "goodbye"  I ain't crying, that's west texas in my eye

too far gone  You're as smooth As Tennessee whiskey You're as sweet As strawberry wine You're as warm As a glass of brandy And honey, I stay stoned on your love All the time  I've looked for love in all the same old places Found the bottom of the bottles always dry But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it 'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high  You're as smooth As Tennessee whiskey You're as sweet As strawberry wine You're as warm As a glass of brandy And honey, I stay stoned on your love All the time  You're as smooth As Tennessee whiskey You're as sweet As strawberry wine You're as warm As a glass of brandy Honey, I stay stoned on your love All the time You're as smooth As Tennessee whiskey Tennessee Whiskey Tennessee Whiskey You're as smooth As

It's junked out joint off a backroad A blinkin' window sign with an arrow A gravel Iot chocked full of toolbox trucks Makin' their happy hour way home  When guys like me lose girls like you That's where we run to  They got "Whiskey River" on a jukebox A honky tonk sawdust dance floor A neon, five o'clock, broke clock And plenty damn many when you want one more Of this broke heart fool on an old bar stool Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you  A bunch of good time numbers on the stall door A picture of you on a dart board Them cinder block walls ain't ever been cleaned Still ain't as dirty as you done me  "Whiskey River" on a jukebox A honky tonk sawdust dance floor A neon, five o'clock, broke clock And plenty damn many when you want one more Of this broke heart fool on an old bar stool Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you  When guys like me lose girls like you That's where we run to  We got "Whiskey River" on a jukebox A honky tonk sawdust dance floor A neon, five o'clock, broke clock And plenty damn many when you want one more Of this broke heart fool on an old bar stool Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you Cold as you When the sun goes down On my side of town That lonesome feelin' Comes to my door The whole world turns blue  There's a rundown bar Cross the railroad tracks I've got a table for two Way in the back Where I sit alone And think of losing you  I spend most every night Beneath the light Of a neon moon  Now If you lose your one and only There's always room here for the lonely To watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon  I think of two young lovers Running wild and free I close my eyes And sometimes see You in the shadows Of this smoke-filled room  No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried Or how many lies That I've lied Telling my poor heart He'll come back someday Ooh, but I'll be alright As long as there's light From a neon moon  Ooh, if you lose your one and only There's always room here for the lonely So watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon  The jukebox plays on Drink by drink And the words of every sad song Seem to say what I think And this hurt inside of me Ain't never gonna end  Ooh, but I'll be alright As long as there's light From a neon moon  Ooh, if you lose your one and only There's always room here for the lonely To watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon  To watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon  Ooh, watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon We just tryna catch a good time Even if it takes all night Pass that bottle 'round the campfire Sippin' apple pie moonshine  Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight Like a bobber on a wet line We just tryna catch a good time  Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out We got a spot a couple miles out of town When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down We got them folding chairs leanin' way back No other plans other than relax We ain't worried about tomorrow from where we at  We just tryna catch a good time Even if it takes all night Pass that bottle 'round the campfire Sippin' apple pie moonshine  Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight Like a bobber on a wet line We just tryna catch a good time  Way down here we all

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)  Sunset through a windshield I can see it now like a picture in a frame (Picture in a frame, oh-oh, oh-oh) Blue jeans and t-shirts, who we were We wore it like a name (like a name) I wish I could go back to those days  When the town was the whole world And love was the girl next door Soundtrack was a song in the dark I miss those days when our dreams Were there for chasin' But time was better wasted We were summer young and livin' for a Friday And freedom was a highway (oh-oh, oh-oh) Freedom was a highway (oh-oh, oh-oh)  Barbwire on a fencepost with a crosswind On a road no one was on (no one was on) Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Five deep with our hands up Just singin' along to a hip-hop song I wish I could rewind and replay  When the town was the whole world And love was the girl next door Soundtrack was a song in the dark I miss those days when our dreams Were there for chasin' But time was better wasted We were summer young and livin' for a Friday And freedom was a highway Freedom was a highway  When you're 17 and drivin' You don't think about the road runnin' out No, no, no, no You just keep your eyes on that horizon 'Cause you're wrapped up in now (ooh, ooh) Hey (ooh yeah, ooh yeah) woo!  I wish I could go back to those days When the town was the whole world And love was the girl next door Soundtrack was a song in the dark I miss those days when our dreams Were there for chasin' But time was better wasted We were summer young and livin' for a Friday And freedom was a highway (freedom was a highway) Freedom was a highway, baby (oh yeah)  And freedom was a highway (freedom was a highway) Freedom was a highway (oh-oh, oh-oh) Well the night is my companion And the highway is my home Got me seeking for one last beacon Every single place I roam They say Jesus was a poor man I guess I wish I had a little more him in me Make it easier going on living Heart ache and misery  Sweet, sweet heart of mine, I'm going to break again a million times Or is this too far gone? Or have you turned to stone?  Well I guess I got my bottle I still hold it all the time But it keeps me smiling and singing Helps me fall asleep a little bit better at night They say life is like a dagger Backstage is full of parasites They love you and drain of everything you own Just to feel better about their life  Sweet, sweet heart of mine, I'm going to break again a million times Or is this too far gone? Or have you turned to stone?  Sweet, sweet heart of mine, I'm going to break again a million times Or is this too far gone? Sweet, sweet love of mine, I'm going to break again a million times Or is this too far gone? Or have you turned to stone?
