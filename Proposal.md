## Summary

> For this project, we will use our skills in Natural Language Processing to analyze 4 different music genres. 

## Deliverables

- Sentiment Analysis of lyrics with RNN LSTM
- Top words and/or sentences through Ngrams, frequency analysis
- Name entity recognition analysis
- Word clouds of the top words that appear in each music genre


## Resources

 - APIs for song lyrics, top charts, and any other relevant data from the music industry.


## Additional challenges

- If time allows, we'll consider implementing AWS into the project. One of the ideas so far is to create a bot that suggest song or genre.

- Build a next word prediction algorithm using the music data from a specific genre
