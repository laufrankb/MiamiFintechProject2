## Summary

> For this project, we will use our skills in Natural Language Processing to analyze 4 different music genres. 

## Deliverables

- Top words and/or sentences through Ngrams, frequency analysis
- Sentiment Analysis of lyrics with VADER
- Name entity recognition analysis
- We will generate word clouds of the top words that appear in each music genre


## Resources

 - APIs for song lyrics, top charts, and any other relevant data from the music industry.


## Additional challenges

If time allows, we'll consider implementing AWS into the project. One of the ideas so far is to create a bot that suggest song or genre.
