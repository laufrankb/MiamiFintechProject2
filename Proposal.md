## Summary

> For this project, we will use our skills in Natural Language Processing to analyze 4 different music genres. 

## Deliverables

- Sentiment Analysis of lyrics with VADER and/or RNN LSTM
- Top words through Ngrams, frequency analysis
- Name entity recognition analysis
    - Obtain most common adjectives, nouns or GPEs
- Word clouds of the top words that appear in each music genre
    - Use masks to represent the genre


## Resources

 - APIs for song lyrics, top charts, and any other relevant data from the music industry.


## Additional challenges

- Build a next word prediction algorithm using the music data from a specific genre, using the following:
    - Markov Chains
    - Kneser Ney Interpolated algorithm
